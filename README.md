# Project Kittan

Project Kittan is a little tool which can help all those who have to develop on Microsoft Dynamics NAV. Here's where Project Kittan comes to help you:
  - Massively update modified date and time.
  - Massively add and remove version list tags (with lenght check!).
  - Get a list of objects where a keyword is contained.
  - Get object filters from file (and clipboard too!).
  - Correctly handles different file encodings and locales.

### Developing, testing and deploying Project Kittan

For all those who want to extend the functionality or fix bugs (hope not) here are the prerequisites for developing Project Kittan:

  - Visual Studio 2017 with .NET desktop development workload.
  - Visual Studio 2019 with UWP development workload for APPX builds.
  - XAML Styler (optional but recommended for keeping XAML code in a good shape).

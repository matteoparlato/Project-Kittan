# Project Kittan

Project Kittan is a little tool which can help all those who have to make changes to lots of Microsoft Dynamics NAV objects and so have to update the modified date and time and version list in each of these objects. Here's where Project Kittan comes to help you:
  - Massively update modified date and time.
  - Massively update version list.
  - Checks that the version list is "short enough" in order to avoid import errors according to the selected NAV version.
  - Avoid inserting a version tag which is already included.
  - Preserve accented characters (ANSI encoding used).

### Developing, testing and deploying Project Kittan

For all those who want to extend the functionality or fix bugs (hope not) here are the prerequisites for developing Project Kittan:

  - Visual Studio 2017 with .NET desktop development workload.
  - XAML Styler (optional but recommended for keeping XAML code in a good shape).

When testing the changes press the "GO" button multiple times and check that all the fields in "OBJECT PROPERTIES" are correct. If everything looks good then you're good to commit.
